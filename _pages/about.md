I'm a graduate student in Physics working on creating precision tests of theories beyond Einstein's theory of General Relativity, by looking at specific frequencies in the gravitational waves produced by black hole mergers. 

I love learning about Statistics & Machine Learning, and love to apply in just about any domain.
